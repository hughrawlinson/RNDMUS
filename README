About
=====
RNDMUS is a Python module to facilitate granular audio shuffling. It selects a random sample in the input file, and takes the following n samples where n is an argument. It then adds these to the end of the resulting output file until the file reaches the length specified in an argument.

At the moment, WAV is the only supported audio format, however there are plans to add support for AIFF, FLAC, and MP3. Other popular audio formats may be considered.

There are also plans to add other kinds of audio shuffling functions in later versions.

Usage
=====
RNDMUS.process() is the main method. There are plans to add other kinds of audio shuffling methods in later versions. This method should be executed in the form:

RNDMUS.process(inputFile,outputFile,grainLength,sampLength)

where

inputFile = path to input file
outputFile = path to output file
grainLength = the length of a single 'card' to shuffle
sampLength = the length of the output file


Version Notes
=============
This version has implemented basic functonality, and is intended for public testing. A pre-compiled .pyc file has been included for ease of use.
